# MCTs at INCF
MATLAB Community Toolboxes (MCTs) at the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)

## About this Organization

MATLAB community toolboxes are open-source code distributions of structured functionality built with MATLAB. This organization focuses on new or orphaned codebases, selected based on their potential for broad usage. The central contribution of this organization is to host these community resources. 

The organization aims to develop and maintain consensual guidelines and templates for GitHub repository stewardship. It will also elaborate on and disseminate best practices, including MathWorks’ recommendations for community toolboxes, as relevant in the neuroscience context. Finally, the organization aspires that many of the selected MATLAB community toolboxes will transition to more permanent individual- or organization-led development over time. 

This organization is sponsored by the MATLAB Community Toolbox (MCT) program at MathWorks.
